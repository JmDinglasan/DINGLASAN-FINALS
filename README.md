# DINGLASAN-FINALS
Bank ATM Program

Hello Ma'am Indaleen, here is my final code for our Final Requirement in Structured Programming. Unfortunately, I cannot do one of your specific requests 
for my program (which is to have a criteria for the account and pin number). It is because I can't figure out how to do it. Nevertheless, the only solution
I did is to put an important note for the users, that the account number should be 12-digits and the pin number should be 6-digits. Basically, that is the only
inadequacy/issue in my program.



P.S. I've learned a lot in this subject and I am very grateful for that. Thank you for your teaching, Ma'am Indaleen! :)
